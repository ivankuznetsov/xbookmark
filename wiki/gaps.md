# Wiki Gaps

| Area | Gap | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| Live X verification | OAuth and bookmark API paths need real credentials | Tests cover PKCE/token behavior with stubs, but a full new setup still needs `X_CLIENT_ID`, `X_USER_ID`, and browser login against X. |
| Cross-project wiki | No xbookmark-specific master page found | `/home/asterio/wikis/master/wiki` exists, but `rg` found no `xbookmark`-specific page during refresh. |

## Resolved Bootstrap Validation

- 2026-05-14: Managed llm-wiki config, agent context, post-commit hook, and daily systemd timer were validated for `xbookmark`.
- 2026-05-14: `qmd update`, `qmd embed`, and collection-scoped `qmd search` passed for `xbookmark`. QMD tries GPU first and falls back to CPU on this host because Vulkan headers are missing.
- 2026-05-14: `qmd query` can still be slow under the sandboxed local-model path; use `qmd search` for maintenance checks and fall back to `rg` when semantic generation is too slow.
- 2026-05-22: README command/config docs were reconciled to the implemented CLI so new setups do not follow unsupported `schedule`, `--config`, `auth refresh/logout`, `enrich`, or extra backfill/find flags.
- 2026-05-22: README Ruby version and contributor checks were reconciled to the gemspec and RSpec-based test suite.
- 2026-05-22: Scheduler installation is now part of the default setup flow, and QMD registration handles the current `qmd collection add` command shape.
- 2026-05-22: Runtime source, specs, CI config, and project wiki are now on `main`; the older "runtime not on main" gap is resolved.
- 2026-05-22: `.env.example` no longer references a nonexistent `auth login --port` option; setup uses `X_REDIRECT_URI`.
- 2026-05-22: Linux scheduler setup now tries to enable systemd linger automatically so daily timers can run after logout.
- 2026-05-22: Live production backfill exposed a Codex JSONL event-shape drift; `item.completed` agent messages are now parsed.
- 2026-05-22: Media download no longer has a default 200 MB cap; large X videos are allowed to download.
